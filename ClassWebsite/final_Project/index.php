<h1>Project Description</h1> 

<h2>I will be proposing a dynamic web site that will present the techniques learned in this .<br> 
The site will be called Rusty Exotics which will allow user to look up and add vehicles of their choice.<br>  
Each user will belong to a particular group and is given either read or read + write access to all documents in the site.<br>  
A user with read access may download the file, but not alter a file (change and then re-upload) or add a new file.<br>  
Users with read + write access will be able to do both. The site gives users of the group a common place to store and access files,<br>  
pertinent to the function of their group. For instance, users who belong to a particular soccer league would be able to access schedules, rosters, standings, etc.<br>  
for that particular league while users of a Church group might view completely different files.</h4>
